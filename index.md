all the details, but hopefully we can put something new into your bag of
computational tricks.

Why do we call this **“Make for Scientists**? Well, `make` is most often used
by computer programmers for compiling software --- so most of the tutorials
that are out there focus on that use case. We'll focus on scientific workflows
instead, mostly drawn from astronomy. A few mathematical topics will be
*briefly* touched on, but none of them are central to understanding what's
going on. If you're not a scientist, there's nothing scary in here; the
examples will just be tilted in a direction that might be less directly useful
to you.
